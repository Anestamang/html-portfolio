<h1>About Me:</h1>
<p>Myself Anish Tamang. My nationality is Nepali because i am from Nepal.Currently i am working in computer hardware repair company and also learnig web app development course by myself.
  I think its hard to achieve anything by yourself without any guidelines. It gets Depressed sometime that i may achieve my dream or not .Sometimes i feel low about myself but i am trying everyday to push myself upward.<br />
  Sometimes life makes you too weak and closes all your door of success, at that time instead of giving up you have to wait and think for a while that you are not ordinary.<br />
  you are here to achieve and teach those who left their hope that without anyone support you cannot do anything in life.<br />

  I am working by myself and improving myself day by day . In case if i also lose my hope and give up then please dont think you are like me. I write words whatever i want that came in my mind.
   
  I am Nothing but i will be something one day.
